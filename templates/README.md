# Templates

## Starting Out
Find a base template that you wish to use, and proceed as follows:
1. Copy all the `*.html` files here
2. Move `css`, `scss`, `plugins`, `fonts`, `img`, `images` and `js` folders into `/public`
3. Split the `index.html` file included with your base template into two files:
  * Cut out the contents and paste into `home.html`
  * Replace the section cut out with `%%CONTENTS%%`
  * Save what remains (e.g. headers, footers, etc.) as `layout.html`
  * Delete `index.html`
4. For all remaining `*.html` files:
  * Edit, and cut out the duplicate headers and footers
